**Keylogger: Secure Keystroke Logging and Transmission**

**Description:**

This project implements a secure keylogger using Python, socket programming, and the "pynput" module. The keylogger client, installed on the target device, captures keystrokes made by the user and securely transmits them to a designated server. Additionally, the captured keystrokes are stored in a text file for further analysis and record-keeping purposes.

**Key Features:**

**Keystroke Logging:** The keylogger client utilizes the "pynput" module to capture keystrokes made on the target device, including text input and other activities.

**Secure Transmission:** Employing socket programming, the keylogger client securely sends the captured keystrokes to the designated server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data.

 **Text File Storage:** The captured keystrokes are saved in a text file on the server, enabling easy access, analysis, and record-keeping.
 
**Real-Time Monitoring:** The keylogger client offers real-time monitoring, providing immediate insights into user activities as the keystrokes are logged and transmitted.

**Compatibility and Usability:** The project is developed in Python, making it compatible with various operating systems and devices, ensuring broad usability.

**Ethical Considerations:** The project emphasizes the importance of obtaining consent and respecting privacy rights, adhering to legal and ethical boundaries in the monitoring process.

By using this keylogger, users can monitor keystrokes for legitimate purposes such as parental control, employee monitoring, or personal security. The secure transmission and storage mechanisms ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the captured data. The project aims to provide a reliable and customizable keylogger solution while prioritizing user privacy and ethical considerations.
